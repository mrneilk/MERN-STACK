    <h1>PowerPoint Presentation</h1>
    <p>Microsoft PowerPoint is a presentation program,
      created by Robert Gaskins and Dennis Austin
       at a software company named Forethought, Inc.
        It was released on April 20, 1987,
         initially for Macintosh computers only.
          Microsoft acquired PowerPoint for about $14 million three months after it appeared.
           This was Microsoft's first significant acquisition,
            and Microsoft set up a new business unit for PowerPoint in Silicon Valley
            where Forethought had been located.

PowerPoint became a component of the Microsoft Office suite,
first offered in 1989 for Macintosh and in 1990 for Windows, which bundled several Microsoft apps.
 Beginning with PowerPoint 4.0 (1994), PowerPoint was integrated into Microsoft Office development,
  and adopted shared common components and a converged user interface.</p>
