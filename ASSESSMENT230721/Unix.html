    <h1>Unix</h1>
    <p>Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive
      from the original AT&T Unix, whose development started in the 1970s at the Bell
      Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.
      Initially intended for use inside the Bell System, AT&T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s,
      leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of
      California, Berkeley (BSD), Microsoft (Xenix), Sun Microsystems (SunOS/Solaris), HP/HPE (HP-UX),
      and IBM (AIX). In the early 1990s, AT&T sold its rights in Unix to Novell, which then sold its
       Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) in 1995. The UNIX trademark passed to The
        Open Group, an industry consortium founded in 1996, which allows the use of the mark for
        certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification (SUS).
         However, Novell continues to own the Unix copyrights, which the SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc.
         court case (2010) confirmed.</p>
